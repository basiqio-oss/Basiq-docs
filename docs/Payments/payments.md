Partners can access three different actions when it comes to payments: Collect, Send, & Receive. The action you require will depend on the context around which the payment is being made. 

## 1. Collect

`Collect` will enable a partner to **pull funds** from a users account with a financial institution they have connected. This covers debit scenarios such as **subscriptions, donations, roundups, and micro-investments**.

## 2. Send

`Send` will enable a partner to **disburse funds** directly to a users account with a financial institution they have connected. It is useful for partners who want to cash out their users for things such as **investment payouts and cash backs**. 

## 3. Receive

`Receive` will enable a partner to **accept funds** that have been pushed from a users account with a financial institution to their Basiq partner application. This achieves the same goal as `Collect`, however it is initiated by the payer (user) instead of the payee (partner application). For example an **in-app one off purchase**.

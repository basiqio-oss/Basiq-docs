There are a few things to take into considering when looking at processing times. 

* Processing of payments will only occur on **Australian business days** (Which will exclude weekends, and any public holidays that are observed in Sydney and Melbourne collectively)
* Any payrequests submitted on a business day **before 7pm** will likely be credited to your bank account by the end of the day, 2 business days after the payrequests were submitted successfully.

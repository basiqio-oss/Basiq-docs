## Overview

Due to the strictly regulated nature of the CDR, Basiq is responsible for ensuring any of our partners consuming CDR data via the platform are doing so under an approved CDR access model. The CDR allows multiple pathways for organisations to collect and disclose CDR data and insights, with consumer consent, all of which have different considerations in relation to secure data transfer and data use. In offering these models Basiq not only provides a way for partners to access Open Banking data, but also removes the complexity around things like CDR certificates, conformance test suites (CTS), and dynamic client registration (DCR). 

Initially Basiq will support three of these access models. 

## 1. ADR

##### Partners who have completed their ADR accreditation but have yet to be activated i.e. they require the technical solution to enable them to consumer CDR data.

Under this model, partners will: 

* Have access to their own CDR participant Portal
* Have a **Legal entity name** for the Consent flow
* Have an **Accreditation Number** for the Consent flow
* Will have the ability to create their own **software product**
* Be required to declare Basiq as a “Supporting Party“
* Be required to display the ADR's name and ADR's accreditation number on the dashboard provided to consumers.

## 2. Sponsor/Affiliate

##### Partners who Basiq have sponsored.

 \
Under this model, partners will: 

* Have their own **CDR participant Portal,** and will not need to use the Sponsor’s (Basiq) participant portal. Basiq will help partners with this portal setup.
* Have their **own brand** and a **Legal entity name** within. Basiq needs this for the consent flow.
* Have an **Accreditation Number** for the Consent flow
* Be required to declare Basiq as a “Supporting Party“ and have a link to our CDR policy
* Be required to display the sponsor's name and sponsor's accreditation number in the dashboard provided to consumers

## 3. Principal/Representative

##### Partners who Basiq have accepted as Representatives.

Under this model, partners will: 

* Need to use the Basiq CDR participant Portal
* Have their own **Legal entity name** within. Basiq needs this for the consent flow.
* Not have an Accreditation Number for the Consent flow, instead Basiq's will be displayed as a supporting party
* Use the Basiq CDR Certificate
* Be required to declare Basiq as a “Supporting Party“ and the accredited person, have the Basiq **Accreditation Number** and have a link to Basiq's CDR policy.
* The dashboard provided to consumers by a representative must display the Principal's name and principal's accreditation number

With the new dashboard comes the concept of users, rather than assessments. A user and an assessment are ultimately one and the same - a bucket in which we can aggregate financial data - however there are some subtle differences between the two, including new features and data points you can now access via a user. 

<Table align={["left","left","left"]}>

      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        ### What is it?
      </td>

      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        An assessment in the Classic Dashboard is a way to capture all the financial details for a specific person a group of people, like a bucket of information.

        When creating an assessment an Assessment ID is generated to be able to identify that assessment uniquely. 

        You can also add in a First Name and Last Name for the assessment to make it easier to identify for a human.

        As user in the New Dashboard is a way to capture all the financial details for a specific person or a group of people, like a bucket of information.

        When creating the user a user ID is generated to be able to identify that user uniquely. 

        It is required to input an Email and a Mobile Number for this user in the dashboard to make it easier to identify for a human.  We do not do a verification of check these emails from Basiqâ€™s side. You can also include First Name, Middle Name and Last Name for this user object.

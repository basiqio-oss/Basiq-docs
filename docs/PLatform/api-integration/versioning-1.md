Your API version controls the API behaviour you see e.g. what properties you see in responses, what parameters youâ€™re permitted to send in requests etc.

In order to gain access to the API, you need to pass the appropriate version in HTTP header basiq-version, when[ exchanging ](https://api.basiq.io/reference/authentication)your API key for a token. 

You don't need to pass basiq-version header in any subsequent requests. 

**Latest version: 2.1**\
**Stable version: 3.0**

```json Example Request
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
basiq-version: 3.0
```

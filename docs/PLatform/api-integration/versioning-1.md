Your API version controls the API behaviour you see e.g. what properties you see in responses, what parameters youâ€™re permitted to send in requests etc.

In order to gain access to the API, you need to pass the appropriate version in HTTP header basiq-version, when[ exchanging ](https://api.basiq.io/reference/authentication)your API key for a token. 

You don't need to pass basiq-version header in any subsequent requests. 

**Latest version: 2.1** 
**Stable version: 3.0**

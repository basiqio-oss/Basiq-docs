## Overview:

Connection objects are created when a user connects their financial institution with your app. These connections act as channels that fetch and store account holders' data, such as accounts and transactions, against the User object. To maintain data integrity and simplify management, it is recommended to interact with account data through the User object rather than directly via the connection.

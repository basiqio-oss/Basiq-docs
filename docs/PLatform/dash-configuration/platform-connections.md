Connections are a core feature that securely link your usersâ€™ financial institutions to your app, allowing for real-time data synchronization. This guide will walk you through managing connections using the dashboard and API, while offering best practices for developers.

## What is a Connection?

<Accordion title="What is a Connection?" icon="fa-info-circle">
  A **Connection** is created whenever a user links their financial institution with your app. It acts as a secure conduit to fetch and store account holder data (e.g., accounts, transactions, and enrich insights). Connections are tied to the **User Object**.

  > ðŸ“˜ **Pro Tip:**
  >
  > Interact with accounts and transactions through the **User Object**, not the connection itself, to ensure data integrity.
</Accordion>

    ## Actions on a Connection

    Developers can manage connections using the following actions:

    <Accordion title="Refresh Connection" icon="fa-sync">
      Use this action to fetch the latest data from the financial institution without creating a new connection. A `job resource` is triggered asynchronously to update account and transaction data.

      **Steps:**

      * Select the connection.
      * Click **Refresh** to sync data.
      * Track the progress in the **Job History** section.

      > ðŸ“˜ **Pro Tip:**
      >
      > Regularly refresh connections to keep your data up-to-date.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Purge Connection" icon="fa-trash-alt">
      Removes **all user data** related to a specific financial institution.

      **When to use:**

      * Before refreshing enriched data to ensure insights are accurate.
      * To securely delete sensitive user data.

      > info
      > Always **purge and refresh connections** to ensure enriched insights reflect the latest data.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Revoke/Delete Connection" icon="fa-ban">
      Permanently unlinks the financial institution. This action:

      * Does not delete stored account or transaction data.
      * Is irreversible.

      **When to use:** When a user decides to disconnect their institution or when the connection is no longer needed.
    </Accordion>
  </Column>

  <Column>
    ## Connection Profile Overview

    When selecting a connection, the **Connection Profile** displays the following details:

    <Cards columns={1}>
      <Card title="Full Name" icon="fa-user">
        The name of the account holder.
      </Card>

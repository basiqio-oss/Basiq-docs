# Overview

Business Consumer Consent (BCC) within Australia's Consumer Data Right (CDR) expands data sharing options for business consumers. This document outlines integrating Basiq's consent UI into a service provider's platform, facilitating secure and compliant data sharing with business consumers. Before proceeding with integration steps, let's explore how to interact with the BCC. 

## What is Business Consumer Consent?

Business Consumer Consent allows businesses to share financial data with a broader range of service providers beyond the traditional "Trusted Adviser" list. This includes professionals such as bookkeepers, finance brokers, insurance brokers, and business coaches. By providing consent, businesses can access a wider array of financial services and applications to streamline operations and make more informed decisions.

To interact with the Business Consumer Consent UI, partners can configure various aspects through the Customiser. These include setting the Brand, purpose, scope, consent period, and data retrieval period. Additionally, it's essential to integrate consent management and re-authorization as mandatory steps in the integration process.

### Key Benefits:

 **Data Sharing:** Gain flexibility to share financial data with a broader range of service providers, enabling access to a wider array of financial services and applications.

**Financial Management:** Streamline financial administration processes, including payroll, invoicing, payments, accounting, and tax preparation, with access to innovative tools and services.

**Access to Funding Options**: Unlock opportunities to access various funding options, including asset finance and business loans, by sharing bank statements with finance brokers.

**Compliance and Security**: Rest assured that data sharing is compliant with the latest regulations under the Consumer Data Right framework, ensuring the highest standards of data privacy and security.

## Integration Steps

**Create Business Application**

Create a Business application to initiate the integration process. Ensure that the business user possesses a valid Australian Business Number (ABN) or Australian Company Number (ACN) before proceeding. Use Basiq's API to create a business user profile with the required attributes.

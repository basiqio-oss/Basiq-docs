Our Consent Management System is designed to streamline the handling of user consents in compliance with regulatory requirements and user preferences. This system is divided into several key components, each addressing specific functionalities required to manage and maintain user consents effectively. Below is a brief overview of each component:

## Consent Management:

This is the central aspect of the system, focusing on the overall mechanisms and strategies used to handle user consents. It includes the creation, storage, and retrieval of consent records, ensuring that user data is handled legally and ethically.

### Consent Scopes:

Details the different levels and areas of consent that can be granted by users, specifying what types of data can be accessed and for what purposes. Understanding scopes is important for both users granting consent and for the system to enforce these permissions accurately.

### Consent Actions:

Outlines the actions that can be performed within the consent interface. These actions include creating, managing, extending, updating, and revoking consents. Each action is tailored to accommodate specific user needs and legal requirements.

### Consent Parameters:

Describes the parameters that can be passed to the consent interface to customize and control the consent flows. These parameters help in directing the consent process according to predefined conditions such as user ID, institution ID, and connection ID.

### Consent Events:

Covers the events triggered by changes in the consent status, such as the creation of a new consent or the expiration of an existing one. Monitoring these events is essential for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the consent records.

If you're looking to transition your users from a traditional Web-based connection to an OpenBanking (OB) connection, follow these straightforward steps to ensure a smooth migration.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process:

### **Prepare for Migration:**

* **Verify OpenBanking Configuration:** Ensure that the institution is set to OpenBanking in your [applicationâ€™s configuration](https://dashboard.basiq.io/customise-ui). This is a prerequisite for migrating to an OB connection.

### **Purge Existing Data:**

* **Data Clean-Up:** Prior to the migration, it's essential to remove the existing user data for the specific institution. To achieve this, use the ['Purge Connection Data' endpoint](https://api.basiq.io/reference/purgeconnectiondata). This step is a necessary prerequisite to ensure a seamless transition to the OB connection.

> ðŸ“˜ Note: This action must be performed before deleting the Web connection as the purge function only works for active connections.

### **Delete Existing Web Connection:**

* **Remove Current Connection:** [Delete the user's existing Web connection](https://api.basiq.io/reference/deleteconnection). It's important to note that a user cannot have both Web and OB connections active simultaneously for the same institution. This step is crucial to avoid conflicts and ensure compliance with connection policies.

### **Establish New OB Connection:**

* **Create the OB Connection:** Once the Web connection is deleted and data is purged, you can proceed to establish a new OB connection for the user.

### Reminders and Tips:

* **Inform Your Users:** Keep your users informed about these changes. Clear communication can help them understand the benefits of migrating to an OpenBanking connection and what to expect during the process.

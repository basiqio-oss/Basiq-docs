When making the move from the classic dashboard to [the new one](https://dashboard.basiq.io), there are a number of new features for you to take advantage of. This guide is your one stop shop when it comes to navigating the dashboard, whether it's brand new functionality, or the core basics you're used to. 

## What's new?

As a platform, we are always working hard to evolve and ensure that our platform and tools are best of breed. The new dashboard is a direct result of this. We have taken the core functionality that so many partners rely on, improved it, and packaged it up with a wealth of new features that empower dashboard partners. Among these new features are:

- Vast improvements to the performance, layout and user experience,
- Greater visibility when it comes to users (previously known as assessments in the classic dash) and their data, 
- Tooling to make error resolution and troubleshooting simple,
- Tighter security with the ability to tailor and restrict team members permissions,
- Easy UI customisation,
- And much more!

## Introduction

If you want to jump right in, you can head over to [dashboard.basiq.io](https://dashboard.basiq.io) and get started. If you'd prefer to ease into things, we've compiled a few short videos (2-5 minutes each) to walk you through each of the amazing new features you can access within the new dashboard!

### Users _(new!)_

One of the concepts which will be new to partners moving from the classic dashboard is the concept of a "User", instead of what was previously an "Assessment". While the name is different, the behaviour typically remains the same. You can read more about the relationship between assessments and users [here](ref:assessments-vs-users).

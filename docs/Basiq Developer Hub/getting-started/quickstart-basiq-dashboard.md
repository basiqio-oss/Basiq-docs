## Editing profile account settings and enabling 2FA

Edit your profile details and keep your account secure by enabling two factor authentication.

### Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

We are preparing to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. Here’s what you need to know:

**MFA will apply to:**

- Paid partners and all organisation members.

**MFA will not apply to:**

- Sandbox partners.
- Partners using SSO.

#### Setting Up MFA:

Refer to our [documentation](https://api.basiq.io/docs/quickstart-basiq-dashboard#editing-profile-account-settings-and-enabling-2fa) for guidance on setting up MFA. The below demo reflects the updated UI design.

- **Locked Out by MFA**: If a member is locked out due to incorrect MFA setup (e.g., losing access to phone or authenticator), the partner (admin) can delete their Member account and re-invite them. If an admin partner is locked out, please contact our support team.

#### Preferred MFA Method:

We recommend using authenticator apps, as they do not rely on SMS services for login.

## Application setup

Establish your application environments with ease in the dashboard. 

**Basiq’s recommendation when setting up applications:**

- Each application created will have its own data. Data cannot be shared between applications, including users. We recommend you create an application for production & an application for dev as bare minimum. You can create as many applications as you like, depending on the approach you aim to take.

# Phase 2 - Design

***

## Customising your consent UI via the dashboard editor

Our integrated CDR compliant consent UI provides organisations with an out of the box solution to manage the complex nature of capturing customers consent to access their financial data. Quickly edit and configure an application’s consent UI and flow in just a few clicks via the Basiq dashboard, removing the need to update JSON files. From the customise UI editor you can also:

- Personalising text and messaging that greets end users so it aligns with your brand’s tone of voice. All consent policy fields can be configured including duration, policies, text and more.
- Configuring institutions you want to show or hide to end users. Allowing multiple institution connections, to determine if your end user should be able to connect more than one institution at a time.
- Preview changes in real time in the Dashboard UI editor before publishing to your live application. 
- Determine data management behaviour by choosing how you would like to handle your end users data after consent revocation.

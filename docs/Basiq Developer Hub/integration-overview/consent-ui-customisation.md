## Introduction

The Consent UI is a key feature of the Basiq platform, designed to make it easy for you to get and handle user consents â€” a crucial part of effectively using data and payment services. It blends smoothly into your app with a simple URL redirect and offers a range of customization options through the Basiq Dashboard. With these tools, you can tailor the Consent UI to match your app's look and feel, providing a seamless and familiar experience for your users. Here is a list of features and benefit of the Consent UI:

* **Seamless Integration and Customisation**: Easily embeddable into applications via URL redirect with a customisable interface through the Basiq Dashboard, allowing for seamless integration and alignment with your application's branding.

* **Efficient Consent and Data Management**: Streamlines the process of obtaining and managing user consents in a compliant manner, while also enabling secure connectivity with financial institutions and facilitating payment setup if using Basiq payment services.

* **Enhanced User Experience and Control**: Provides a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall experience, coupled with features that allow users to view, manage, and extend their consents, offering greater transparency and control.

* **Regulatory Compliance and Data Security**: Ensures adherence to regulatory standards like the Consumer Data Rights, reducing the risk of non-compliance in data access and payment services, and upholds data security and privacy norms.

* **Time Efficiency and Market Readiness**: Reduces development time and resources by providing a ready-to-use, compliant solution, accelerating the market readiness of applications and offering developers flexibility and control over the user interface.

### Key Interfaces

The Consent UI is composed of several key screens, each designed to facilitate a different aspect of user interaction:

* **Consent Capture Screen**: This is the initial touchpoint where users are informed about the data access request. It is crucial for transparency and user trust, detailing the type of data accessed and its intended use.

* **Institution Selection Screen**: Users select their financial institution from a comprehensive list on this screen. This step is vital for establishing a secure and reliable connection for data retrieval.

* **Data Holder Screens**: These screens are controlled by the financial institutions themselves. They handle crucial steps such as user authorisation and account selection. While these screens are integral to the process, they remain under the purview of the respective financial institutions, ensuring security and compliance in user authentication and data access.

* **Consent Management Screen**: This interface allows users to view and manage their existing consents. It's a critical component for maintaining user control over their data.

* **Consent Extension Screen**: In cases where consent is nearing its expiration, this screen facilitates the extension process, ensuring uninterrupted service and data access.

## Consent UI Integration

> ðŸš§ Important Notice:
>
> Embedding the Consent UI is not supported. Due to bank security policies, the Consent UI cannot be embedded using methods such as iframes. Instead, you must implement the full redirect provided by Basiq.

### Redirect Method:

To integrate the Consent UI, follow these steps to implement the full redirect:

1. **Initiate the Consent Process**: Start by creating a consent request through Basiq's API.
2. **Redirect to Consent UI**: Use the URL provided in the response to redirect the user to the Consent UI.
3. **Complete the Consent**: Once the user completes the consent process, they will be redirected back to your application with the job id's.

This approach ensures compliance with bank security requirements and maintains the integrity of the user's financial data.

## User Management

The 'Users' section is dedicated to managing users associated with your applications. Here, you'll find detailed information about users' financial connections, transactions, and accounts. It's also where you can create and manage 'magic links' for requesting user consent, ensuring compliance and secure data access.

The 'Reports' section enables you to generate and view insightful reports. These reports provide valuable insights into financial data, aiding in informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Status Monitoring

In the 'Status' section, monitor the real-time status of connectors to financial institutions. This monitoring ensures seamless data integration and helps in quickly addressing any connectivity issues.

## Help and Support

The 'Help' section provides access to a range of support options and resources, including FAQs, user guides, and direct contact information for further assistance. This section is your go-to resource for any queries or guidance needed while using the dashboard.

## Settings Configuration

The 'Settings' section is where you configure company-wide settings, including enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO) and managing permission sets. This section also allows for the invitation and management of team members, granting them access to the dashboard with appropriate permissions.

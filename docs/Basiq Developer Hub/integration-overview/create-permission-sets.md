### Step 1: Accessing Permission Sets

To begin, log in to the Basiq Dashboard and navigate to the 'Settings' tab. Here, you will find the 'Permission Sets' option, which is your gateway to managing access controls.

### Step 2: Creating a New Permission Set

Click on 'New Permission Set' to start creating a new set. Assign a descriptive name that clearly identifies the set's purpose. This name is crucial for easy management and recognition of the set's role.

### Step 3: Assigning Permissions

In this step, you select the specific API endpoints that the permission set will have access to. These endpoints typically include Get, Post, and Delete requests. For example, by selecting 'Delete user', the permission set is endowed with the capability to remove users from the system. This method of assigning permissions ensures that each set can be finely tuned to the exact needs of its role, providing a tailored and secure user experience.

### Step 4: Saving and Activating Permission Sets

Once you have configured your permission sets, save your changes to activate them. These sets become effective immediately, enforcing the defined access controls without delay.

## Best Practices

* **Adhere to Least Privilege**: Ensure that each role or API key is granted only the permissions necessary for its function.
* **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly review your permission sets to ensure they align with evolving roles and responsibilities.
* **Use Clear Naming Conventions**: Choose descriptive names for your permission sets to facilitate easy identification and management.
* **Role Specificity**: Design permission sets that are specific to the roles in your organization. Avoid one-size-fits-all approaches, as they can lead to over-privileging or under-privileging.
* **Segregate Duties**: Where possible, distribute permissions among roles to prevent any single role from having excessive access, reducing risks of misuse.
* **Update with Organizational Changes**: Modify permission sets in tandem with any changes in organizational structure or roles to maintain appropriate access levels.

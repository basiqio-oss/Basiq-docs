### Step 1: Access the Basiq Dashboard

Start by visiting the Basiq Dashboard directly at [dashboard.basiq.io](https://dashboard.basiq.io). Here, you'll find the option to sign up, allowing you to immediately proceed to the registration page.

}
[/block]


### Step 2: Fill Out the Registration Form

Upon accessing the sign-up section, you'll be required to enter your company's information. This includes details like your company name and contact information. It's important to use a secure password for your account's protection. As you sign up, a company profile is automatically created behind the scenes.

**Note on Existing Company Profiles:** Before completing your sign-up, consider if a company profile already exists within your organization. If a colleague has previously created an account, have them invite you via the members management area. This ensures that all team members are consolidated under a single company profile, facilitating better organization and management.

}

### Step 3: Account Verification

Check your email for a verification link from Basiq after registering. This email contains a link that you must click to verify your email address and activate your account.

}
[/block]


### Step 4: Log Into Your Dashboard

Once your account is verified, log back into the Basiq dashboard using your email and secure password. This action takes you to your dashboard, a central hub for managing Basiq’s services.

}
[/block]


### Step 5: Complete Account Setup

In your dashboard, visit the 'Settings' section to finalise your organisation's details, including its name and logo. Crucially, set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security, following the instructions in your account settings.

## Keeping Your Account Safe

After setting up your account, you’ll want to keep it safe. Here are some recommended practices to keep your account protected:

- **Unique Password for Basiq**: Ensure your Basiq password is distinct and not used for any other site. Using the same password on multiple platforms increases the risk of unauthorized access if one of those sites is compromised.

- **Utilise Team Members for Account Access**: To grant access to your Basiq account, use the team members feature. This allows you to invite others to your account with limited permissions, enabling them to perform specific actions without full access.

- **Regularly Update Your Computer and Browser**: Keep your computer and browser updated to protect against automated attacks and malware. Configuring your system for automatic updates, whether it’s macOS or Windows, can significantly enhance your digital security.

- **Stay Vigilant Against Phishing**: Basiq’s authentic sites all use the basiq.io domain and HTTPS. Be cautious with unexpected emails claiming to be from Basiq. Instead of clicking on links in emails, directly visit the Basiq site to log in. If you're unsure about an email's authenticity, contact our support team for verification.

- **Enable Two-Factor Verification**: This additional security layer requires a unique code from your mobile device, received via text message, to complete the login process. This means even if your username and password are compromised, unauthorised login is still prevented. To enable this, navigate to your user settings on the Basiq dashboard.

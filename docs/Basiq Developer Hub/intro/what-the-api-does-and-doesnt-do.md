# What the Basiq API can't do for you

&nbsp;

## ❌  We don't provide write access

Basiq has read only access only, meaning we can not update or create any data when a customer provides their credentials. 

## ❌  We don't expose customer credit card numbers

Credit card numbers are always masked to maintain PCI compliance. 

## ❌  We don't share your data

We take data privacy very seriously and we do not hold onto or share any of your data without your consent.

### Key Configuration Steps:

**1. Application Setup**: Create seperate applications for various development stages or specific use cases. This helps keep your data organised and your production data safe and isolated from your other development environments.

**2. Permission Sets**: Establish role-based permissions for your team members and API keys. This ensures everyone has the right level of access for their role and enhances the protection of sensitive data.

**3. Consent UI Customisation**: Tailor the Consent UI to match your application's branding and specify the services and data required by your application. 

**4. API Key Generation**: For direct integration with Basiq's API services, this section provides a straightforward guide on how to set up and configure your API Keys effectively.

## Overview

The Enrich resource provides detailed transaction data enrichment by enhancing bank transaction descriptions with additional attributes. The service categorises transactions and returns merchant information, location details, and industry-standard categorisation.

The data enrichment process on the Basiq platform involves four key steps:

* **Data Access**
* **Data Tagging, Cleaning, and Tokenization**
* **Data Enrichment**
* **Machine Learning and Final Output**

### Step 1: Data Access

Access a customer's transaction data by linking their bank accounts through Basiq Connect. Customers must provide consent to securely link their accounts and share their transaction information.

### Step 2: Data Tagging, Cleaning, and Tokenization

Once the raw transaction data is collected, it is categorised into debits and credits. Transactions are then tagged, cleaned, and standardised for enrichment. For instance:

* **Debit Transactions**: Bank fees, cash withdrawals, loan interest.
* **Credit Transactions**: Payments to merchants, refunds, interest earned, loan repayments.

Transactions are standardised to handle inconsistent formats across banks, ensuring reliable and accurate enrichment.

### Step 3: Data Enrichment

Enriched data is matched against Basiqâ€™s curated merchant database, which includes merchant identity, location, and categorisation details. 

Enrichment provides:

* **Merchant Information**: Business name, website, ABN, and contact details.
* **Location Information**: Address and geocode location.
* **Category Information**: A 4-level hierarchy of industry-standard categorisation.

### Step 4: Machine Learning and Final Output

When a transaction cannot be immediately categorised, Basiq's machine learning model steps in. This model analyses transactions using additional data sources to ensure accurate categorisation and enrichment. It continuously improves through dynamic learning with each transaction processed.

## Enrich API

The Enrich resource enables you to retrieve details by passing in a search query containing a bank transaction description. The service enriches transaction data with multiple attributes, returning a transaction classification and three metadata components. The transaction classification will first determine if the transaction is of type payment, transfer, cash-withdrawal, bank-fee etc. The engine then derives merchant information, purchase location, and prescribes an industry standard categorisation for each payment transaction.

You can subscribe to one or all of the following three core datasets returned depending on your use case:

### Data

* **Merchant**: Details relating to the store or merchant such as business name, website, ABN, and contact details.
* **Location**: Details relating to the location of the entity such as address and geocode location.
* **Category**: Industry standard categorisation with a 4-level hierarchy for banking transactions.
* **Links**: Provides direct link to the original query and master and thumb merchant logos.

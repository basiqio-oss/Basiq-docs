Our partner ecosystem branches far and wide, but our most common use cases are: 

**Account aggregation:** Access and aggregate all your customers financial data in one place to get a single view of customer finances. Use this to build or add PFM (Personal Financial Management) functionality and provide more tailored product offerings and recommendations.

**Account verification:** Instantly verify account ownership and balances in real time to improve the user experience and mitigate fraud and risk. Use this to automate responsible lending, reduce dishonour fees for payments and improve collections.

**Data Enrichment:** Gain greater insight into customer transactions with powerful overlay services across expense classification, merchant identification, income detection, expense analysis and behavioural spend analytics. Ongoing access to enriched data lets you build next-generation financial planning and wealth management solutions.

excerpt: >-
  The Enrich resource enables you to retrieve details by passing in a search
  query containing a bank transaction description. The service enriches
  transaction data with multiple attributes, returning a transaction
  classification and three metadata components. The transaction classification
  will first determine if the transaction is of type payment, transfer,
  cash-withdrawal, bank-fee etc. The engine then derives merchant information,
  purchase location and prescribes an industry standard categorisation for each
  payment transaction.

A user must be created before connecting to any financial institutions, as this is where data will be aggregated. 

##### We do not check for existing users with the same details

We rely on the ID of the user for uniqueness, so will not do a check for existing users with the same mobile or email. If this is a concern then it should be handled in the partner application. You must only provide a mobile OR an email to create the user.

> ðŸ“˜ For BASIQ Dashboard Only
> 
> You can create users via Basiq dashboard, and you must provide both fields email address and mobile number when creating a user through the Dashboard.

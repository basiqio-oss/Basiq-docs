The statement object represents an official bank statement for an account or accounts held with a financial institution (e.g. a savings account). You can **create** a statement object by uploading official pdf bank statements which are parsed to extract and expose the user's latest account and transaction data.

> Note that the sandbox environment (AU00000) - does not support the Statement upload function. The Statements endpoint should be used to upload csv files or official bank statements against the correct institution.
